Abstract <br>
The rapid evolution of technology has transformed the landscape of education, leading to the emergence of Student Progress Management Systems (SPMS). This project report presents the design and implementation of an integrated platform that combines the functionalities of both LMS and SPMS to facilitate effective online learning and student progress tracking.
The Online Learning Management enables educational institutions to deliver course materials, assessments, and other learning resources through a centralized online platform. It offers features such as content management, user management, discussion forums, and assessment tools to facilitate interactive and engaging learning experiences for students.
The Student Progress Management complements the LMS by providing tools for tracking and monitoring students' progress, performance, and attendance. It includes features such as gradebook management, analytics dashboards, and notification systems to help educators identify at-risk students, provide timely interventions, and improve overall academic outcomes.
The integrated platform offers seamless integration between the LMS and SPMS modules, allowing educators to align learning objectives with student assessments and track progress in real-time. It also provides comprehensive reporting capabilities, enabling stakeholders to gain insights into student performance trends, course effectiveness, and overall institutional outcomes.
Through this project, we aim to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of online education delivery while empowering educators with tools to support student success and academic growth. The proposed platform serves as a valuable resource for educational institutions seeking to adapt to the demands of digital learning environments and improve student outcomes in the digital age.
